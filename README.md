# Fridge-Cleaner-app
Code for first UI based app

This app was created as try to produse useful UI based application to study IOS interface. Main idea is to select ingridients user have inhis/her fridge and, in return, produce list of recipes, which can be created from given products.
application have to views, separetad by Tap Bar. First view shows already selected ingridients and allows editing. Second one - results of recipe searsh in database.

Also, I've added database editor. 

Project still have a lot things to do, like rebuilding architecture for client-server app with database transported to server.
